# The Cybersecurity World
---
#### Websites and Power of Data
- great businesses have been created by collecting and harnessing the power of data and analytics
- these businesses have the responsibility to protect this data from misuse and unauthorized access
#### Cybersecurity Domains
##### Domains
- organizations like Google, LinkedIn, Amazon and others provide important services and opportunity for their customers
- the growth in data collection and analytics poses great risks to individuals and modern life if precautions are not taken to protect sensitive data from criminals
- Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and the Internet of Everything (IoE) have emerged
- this growing collection of data can help people save energy, improve efficiencies, and reduce safety risks
#### Cyber Criminals vs Cybersecurity Specialists
##### Hackers
- White hat - break into networks or computer systems to discover weaknesses in order to improve the security of systems (paid)
- Gray hat - are somewhere between white and black hat attackers, may find a vulnerability and report it to the owners of the system if that action coincides with their agenda (aka bounty hunters, can notify you of vulnerabilities for a price)
- Black hat - unethical criminals who violate computer and network security (personal gain or malicious activities)
##### Other criminals
- Script Kiddies - mostly limited to pranks and vandalism, often using existing tools found on internet
- Vulnerability Brokers - grey hat hackers who attempt to discover exploits (for prizes or rewards)
- Hacktivists - rally and protest against different political or social ideas
- Cyber Criminals - black hats who are either self-employed or working for large cybercrime organizations
- State Sponsored Hackers - either white or black hats who steal govt secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage networks
##### Cybersecurity specialists
Tools for thwarting cybercrime:
- Vulnerability Database
- Early Warning Systems
- Share Cyber Intelligence
- ISM Standards
- New Laws
##### Threat Arenas
- a cybersecurity threat is the possibility that a harmful event such as an attack will occur
- cyber vulnerability is a weakness that makes a target susceptible to an attack
- network services like DNS, HTTP and Online Databases are prime targets for cyber criminals
- criminals use packet-sniffing 
- criminals use rogue devices such as wi-fi access points
- packet forgery (packet injection) interferes with an established ----
##### Domains include:
- **Manufacturing**
	- Industry controls
	- Automation
	- SCADA
- **Energy Production and Distribution**
	- Electrical Distribution and Smart Grid
	- Oil and Gas
- **Communication**
	- Phone
	- Email
	- Messaging
- **Transportation Systems**
	- Air Travel
	- Rail
	- Over the Road

- Personal - everyone needs to safeguard his or her identity, data, and computing devices
- Corporate - it is the employees responsibility

##### How Threats Spread
###### Internal Security Threats
- an internet user, such as an employee or contract partner can accidentally or intentionally spread threats
- have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats because users have direct access to the bldg and infrastructure devices
###### External Threats
- ***

###### Vulnerabilities of Mobile Devices

###### Emergence of Internet of Things
###### Impact of Big Data
- is the result of data sets that are large and complex making ----

##### Threat Complexity

###### Advanced Weapons
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a continuous computer hack that occurs under the radar against a specific object (for business or  political motives)
- Algorithm attacks can track system self-reporting data
###### Broader Scope and Cascade Effect
###### Safety Implications

#### Creating More Experts
Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity
- 7 Categories of Cybersecurity Work
	- **Operate and Maintain** includes providing the support administration, and maintenance required to ensure IT system performance and security
	- **Protect and Defend** includes the identification, analysis
	- **Investigate** includes the investigation of events involving IT resuources
	- **Collect and Operate**
	- **Analyze**
	- **Oversight and Development**
	- **Securely Provision**
