## 🌐 Agile Process Model
> [!info] Definition
> The Agile Model is a flexible, iterative, customer-focused approach that values collaboration, working software, and adaptability over rigid planning and documentation. Several methodologies exist under Agile, each with unique practices.

---

## ❓ What is Agile?
> [!tip] Agile
> - A process that allows a team to manage a project efficiently by breaking it into stages and iterating with stakeholders.  
> - In software development, requirements are discovered and solutions are developed through self-organizing, cross-functional teams together with customers or end-users.

---

## ⚡ Agility
> [!note] Agility
> - Agility is dynamic, context-specific, change-embracing, and growth-oriented.  
> - Encourages team structures and attitudes that simplify communication between members, business people, and managers.  
> - Emphasizes rapid delivery of operational software and de-emphasizes intermediate work-products.  
> - Recognizes limits of planning in uncertain environments.  
> - Can be applied to any software process.

## 🔑 Key Assumptions of Agile Processes
> [!important] Key Assumptions
> 1. Requirements and customer priorities are difficult to predict in advance.  
> 2. Design and construction are interleaved so design is proven while being built.  
> 3. Analysis, design, construction, and testing are not fully predictable.

## 🧭 12 Agility Principles
> [!tip] Principles
> 1. Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software  
> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development  
> 3. Deliver working software frequently, with preference to shorter timescales  
> 4. Business people and developers must work together daily  
> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals  
> 6. The most effective way to convey information is face-to-face conversation  
> 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress  
> 8. Promote sustainable development with a constant pace  
> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility  
> 10. Simplicity is essential, maximizing the amount of work not done  
> 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams  
> 12. At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly

> - Adaptive Software Development (ASD)  
> - Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)  
> - Scrum  
> - Crystal  
> - Feature Driven Development (FDD)

## 🔹 Extreme Programming (XP)
> [!info] Overview
> Widely used agile process, prefers object-oriented development. Activities: Planning, Design, Coding, Testing.

### Planning
> [!note] Planning
> - Begins with creation of user stories written by the customer  
> - Customer assigns priority, team assigns cost  
> - Stories are grouped into increments with delivery dates  
> - Project velocity is used to estimate subsequent delivery dates  

### Design
> [!note] Design
> - Follows "keep it simple" principle  
> - Uses CRC (Class–Responsibility–Collaborator) cards  
> - Spike solutions are design prototypes for difficult problems  
> - Encourages refactoring for iterative refinement  
> - Design occurs both before and after coding  

### Coding
> [!note] Coding
> - Construct unit tests before coding  
> - Pair programming is encouraged for collaboration and quality  
> - Continuous integration with frequent builds  
> - Smoke testing ensures basic and critical functions work  

### Testing
> [!note] Testing
> - Unit tests automated through a framework for regression testing  
> - Integration and validation testing can occur daily  
> - Acceptance tests are specified by the customer and derived from user stories

## 🔹 Adaptive Software Development (ASD)
> [!info] Overview
> Technique for building complex software and systems. Focuses on collaboration and self-organization. Phases: Speculation, Collaboration, Learning.

### Speculation
> [!note] Speculation
> - Outcomes are unpredictable; detailed planning may not yield customer value  
> - Planning is treated as speculation, setting intentions but accepting uncertainty  

### Collaboration
> [!note] Collaboration
> - Balances execution of work and maintaining a collaborative environment  
> - Project manager adapts to uncertainties while planning predictable parts  
> - Joint Application Development (JAD) workshops are used to define requirements and solutions collaboratively  

### Learning
> [!note] Learning
> - Learning cycles of design, build, and testing correct mistakes from false assumptions or misunderstandings  
> - Shared learning cycles build mastery of the problem domain  

---

## 🔹 Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
> [!info] Overview
> Framework for building systems under tight time constraints using incremental prototyping. Follows the 80% rule: deliver just enough to move forward, refine later.

### Life Cycle
> [!note] Phases
> 1. **Feasibility study** — establish business requirements and constraints, check viability  
> 2. **Business study** — define requirements, architecture, and maintainability needs  
> 3. **Functional model iteration** — create prototypes demonstrating functionality  
> 4. **Design and build iteration** — refine prototypes to provide operational business value  
> 5. **Implementation** — deploy and test the increment in the real environment  

---

## 🔹 Scrum
> [!info] Overview
> Principles consistent with Agile Manifesto. Framework activities: requirements, analysis, design, evolution, delivery. Teams usually have 5–9 people but can scale.

### Roles
> [!note] Roles
> - **Product Owner** — represents stakeholders, manages backlog  
> - **Scrum Master** — ensures team productivity, removes blockers  
> - **Scrum Team** — no fixed roles, collective responsibility  
> - **Product Backlog** — prioritized list of features or changes  
> - **Sprint Backlog** — tasks committed for the sprint  

### Events
> [!note] Events
> - **Sprint Planning** — select backlog items to complete during sprint  
> - **Daily Scrum** — short meeting for coordination and progress tracking  
> - **Sprint Review** — demo of completed functionality at sprint end  
> - **Sprint Retrospective** — reflection on what went well and what to improve  

---

## 🔹 Crystal
> [!info] Overview
> A family of lightweight methodologies based on team size, criticality, and priorities.

### Variants
> [!note] Variants
> - **Crystal Clear** — 1–6 people, short-term, co-located  
> - **Crystal Yellow** — 7–20 people, real-user feedback, automated testing  
> - **Crystal Orange** — 21–40 people, 1–2 years, releases every 3–4 months  
> - **Crystal Orange Web** — for evolving public codebases, multiple initiatives  
> - **Crystal Red** — 40–80 people, larger projects  
> - **Crystal Maroon** — 80–200 people, very large projects  
> - **Crystal Diamond & Sapphire** — used in very large projects with potential risk to human life

## 🔹 Feature Driven Development (FDD)
> [!info] Overview
> Features are small, client-valued functions expressed as “Action result object.”  
> Model-driven process with two-week iterations: design by feature, build by feature.

### Eight Practices
> [!note] Practices
> 1. Domain Object Modeling  
> 2. Developing by Feature  
> 3. Component or Class Ownership  
> 4. Feature Teams  
> 5. Inspections  
> 6. Configuration Management  
> 7. Regular Builds  
> 8. Visibility of Progress and Results  

---

## 🔹 Agile Modeling (AM)
> [!info] Overview
> Practice-based methodology that complements Agile by providing lightweight modeling and documentation.

### Key Outputs
> [!note] Outputs
> - **User Stories** — short, simple statements of functionality from a user’s perspective, replacing long requirement specs  
> - **Lightweight Diagrams** — quick visuals like use case diagrams, class diagrams, workflow sketches, often created on whiteboards or sticky notes  
> - **Iteration Notes** — summaries of planned features for upcoming sprints or iterations  
> - **Acceptance Criteria** — simple conditions that determine if a user story is complete, guiding testing  
> - **Team Agreements** — documented decisions on tools, design conventions, or processes
