> [!NOTE]  ### Agile Process Model
> - a flexible, iterative, and customer-focused approach that values collaboration, working software, and adaptability
> -  is a process that allows a team to more efficiently manage a project by breaking it down into several stages
> - involve discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer/end user

> [!NOTE]  Agility
> - is a dynamic, content specific, aggressively change embracing, and growth oriented
> - encourages team structures and attitudes that make communication

#### 12 Agility Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
4. Business people  and developers must work together
5. Build projects---
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information o and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
10. Simplicity

#### Agile Process Models
1. Extreme Programming (XP) 
	- most widely used agile process model
	- uses OOP approach as its preferred development paradigm
	- Planning, Design, Coding, and Testing
2. Adaptive Software Development (ASD)
	- Speculation 
		- refers to the planning paradox; outcomes are unpredictable, therefore endless suppositions on a product's look and feel 
	- Collaboration
		- represents a balance between managing the doing and creating and maintaning the collaborative environment
		- JAD (Joint Application Development) - approach where developers, users, and stakeholders work together
	- Learning
		- Correcting those mistakes through shared learning cycles leads to greater positive experience and eventual mastery of the problem
3. Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
	- approach that "provides a framework for building and maintaining systems which meet tight time constraints "
	- best for Business
	- 80% rule
	- Life Cycle:
		- Feasibility study - establishes the basic business requirements and constraints
		- Business study - establishes the functional and information requirements, also identifies maintainability requirements
		- Functional Model Iteration - produces a set of incremental prototypes that demonstrate functionality for the customer
		- Design and Build Iteration - ---
4. Scrum
	- consistent with the agile manifesto
	- "We're all in this together"
	-  Scrum Terms
		- Product Owner - users, customers, stakeholders
		- Scrum Master - Project Manager, responsible for the team
		- Product Backlog - prioritized features list, desired features
		- Sprint planning meeting - presents the top items on the product backlog, moving product backlog to sprint backlog
		- Daily Scrum - helps set the context for each day's work
		- Sprint review meeting - demonstrates the completed functionality 
		- Sprint retrospective - reflection and decision how to improve
5. Crystal
	-  lightweight methodology
	- Variants:
		- Crystal Clear
		- Crystal Yellow
		- Crystal Orange
		- Crystal Orange Web
		- Crystal Red - 40-80 members
		- Crystal Maroon
		- Crustal Diamond & Sapphire
6. Feature Driven Development (FDD) 
	-  Features are an important aspect
	- a feature is a small, client-valued function expressed in the form "Action result object"
		- 8 Practices
			- Domain Object Modeling
			- Developing by feature

7. Agile Modeling (AM)
	- is a practice-based methodology that complements agile software development
	- providing lightweight approaches for modeling and documentation
	- Key Outputs:
