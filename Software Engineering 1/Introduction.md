## Software
Encompasses:
- Instructions (computer programs)
-  ***

##### Categories of software
- System software - manages hardware and basic sys operations
- Application software - designed for end-user tasks
- Engineering/scientific software
- Embedded software
- Product-line software - designed for a broad consumer market
- Web applications - network-centric software accessed via a browser
- AI software 

#### Software Engineering
Seminal definition
- the establishment of use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable

IEEE definition
- application of systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach


| **Product characteristic** | **Description**                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Maintainable               | Software should be written in such a way so that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers |
| Dependability and security | Includes a range of characteristics including reliability, security, and safety                        |
| Efficiency                 | Software should not make wasteful use of system resources                                              |
| Acceptability              | Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed                              |

### 8 Software Engineering ethical principles
1. **Public** - act consistently with the public interest: prioritize safety, privacy, and societal well-being
2. **Client & Employer** - serve clients and employers faithfully, without compromising public interest. 
3. **Product** - Ensure software meets the highest professional
4. **Judgement** - Maintain integrity and independence in professional decisions
5. **Management** - promote ethical management of software projects
6. **Profession** - Advance the integrity and reputation of software engineering
7. **Colleagues** - Treat colleagues fairly, respectfully, and support professional development
8. **Self** - continuosly improve professional competence through lifelong learning

### Software Engineering Layers
##### 1. Tools
- provide automated or semi-automated support for the process and the methods
- CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering)
##### Methods
- provides the technical aspects for building software
- encompass a broad array of tasks that include communication, requirements analysis, design modeling, program construction
##### Process Model
- defines a framework that must be established for effective delivery of software engineering technology
##### Quality Focus
- The foundation that supports software engineering is a quality focus

#### Software Engineering Concepts
1. **Generic Process Model** - a generic process model represents a high-level view of software development. Breaks down to these fundamental phases:
	1. Communication
	2. Planning
	3. Modeling
	4. Construction
	5. Deployment
2. **Process Flow**
	- Linear - straightforward
	- Iterative - repeats
	- Evolutionary - increments (cycle)
	- Parallel
3. Umbrella activities

##### Process Model
- defined as a collection of work activities

1. Waterfall Model - classic life cycle. systematic and sequential approach to software development
2. Incremental Process Model - combination of linear and parallel process flow
3. Rad (rapid application Development) 
	- type of incremental model, components or functions are developed in parallel mini projects
	- in teams
4. Prototype Process Model -  prototype is based on the currently known requirements, client can get an actual feel of the system
5. Spiral Process Model
6. Concurrent Process Model
7. Agile
