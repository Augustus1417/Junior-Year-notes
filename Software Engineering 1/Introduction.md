### 🏛️ Layers of Software Engineering  

> [!note] **4 Core Layers**  
> 1. **Tools** → automate/semi-automate tasks (integrated = **CASE**)  
> 2. **Methods** → technical tasks: analysis, design, coding, testing, support  
> 3. **Process Model** → framework & project control  
> 4. **Quality Focus** → foundation for all layers

### 🔄 Software Engineering Concepts  

> [!important] **Generic Process Model**  
> - **Communication** → gather requirements  
> - **Planning** → estimate effort, cost, schedule  
> - **Modeling** → design models & specs  
> - **Construction** → coding & testing  
> - **Deployment** → delivery & maintenance  

> [!important] **Process Flow Types:**  
> - **Linear** → step-by-step  
> - **Iterative** → repeat stages when needed  
> - **Evolutionary** → circular, grows system with each cycle  
> - **Parallel** → multiple activities at once  

>[!important] **Umbrella Activities** 
>- **Umbrella Activities**→ span all phases (QA, documentation, project mgmt).

### 🧩 Process Models  

| **Model**       | **Key Idea**                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Waterfall**   | Classic, sequential: requirements → design → code → test → deploy              |
| **Incremental** | Linear sequences delivered in increments                                       |
| **RAD**         | Time-boxed mini-projects developed in parallel, then assembled                 |
| **Prototype**   | Build quick mock-up to refine requirements before full design                  |
| **Spiral**      | Iterative + risk-driven (with **anchor milestones**)                           |
| **Concurrent**  | Activities run in parallel but in different states                             |
| **Agile**       | Flexible, iterative, customer-focused; emphasizes collaboration & adaptability |
